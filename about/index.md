A relict of the once prosperous Glob Group of publications, the Evening * Glob continues in the tradition of its predecessors *The Japester*, *Prise de Fer*, and *Bray*. 

Regrettably, the Glob archives from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries remain under
seal, and so this site can only present a small sampling of the prodigious output of
the Evening * Glob. The staff of Consolidated Glob hope that the remaining litigation
can be resolved satisfactorily, in the fullness of time.
