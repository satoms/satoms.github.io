_The Geek Chorus:_ Dood, what gives? 

_Myself:_ Are you enjoying our new format?

_The Geek Chorus:_ Man, I think I prefer a dead site.

_Myself:_ But this is a de luxe presentation of  famous _Diary_ of the Polish author Witold Gombrowicz, in thrilling daily installments!

_The Geek Chorus:_ Neat. Plagiarism.

_Myself:_ I beg your pardon! I am using an entirely new translation of the pronoun.

_The Geek Chorus:_ Uh, waitasec. OK, back.

_Myself:_ Yes?

_The Geek Chorus:_ Just had to do a quick search. You know that old Gomby wrote the _Diary_ in English, right?

_Myself:_ . . .

_The Geek Chorus:_ Like I said, nice one.

_Myself:_ Isn't your guild expecting you?

_The Geek Chorus:_ Oh, crap. You're right, dood, gotta run. 

_Myself:_ Goodbye.
