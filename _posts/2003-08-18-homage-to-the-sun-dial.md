title: HOMAGE TO THE SUN-DIAL
---

Upon arriving at the office this morning, I was surprised to see a pop-up dialog on my screen indicating that my workstation had crashed overnight.  Upon restarting it, everything worked as well as before, except that there was a strange bounced email in my inbox.  Those of us who have been infected with viruses know the hideous feeling kindled by such a variation from the old routine.  

Examining the email, which had been reflected by the postmaster of a prominent domain I'm not at liberty to mention (three-letter domain, you see), I noticed that in fact the contents were addressed to me. Verbatim, they read as follows:

	r41|_3r33 15 1n my s0u|_

Or, in the orthography of the non-leet:

Needless to say, I am somewhat shocked by the implications of this email, if genuine. After seriously debating whether to install a filter, I have decided to comply and leave a little notepad running for my nocturnal visitor. I look forward to learning more about the current state of the tech world from what appears to be a real insider. I only hope that it is as nice a process as it seems to be.
