Due to a recent appeal to our Standards Board, the publication history of the Glob has been redacted to remove all recent items that have caused offense to our older readers. These admittedly salacious and vicious articles, calculated to pander to the basest instincts in our readership, are now available for sale through the Brown Paper Wrapper imprint of Glob Press. 

Each item is published as a de luxe illustrated pamphlet set in large type, suitable for enjoyment by language learners. Many pamphlets deal with scientific subjects of wide interest, particularly human anatomy and corporate finance. A complete catalogue of subjects is available upon written request to Editrix, Glob Press, care of this column.
