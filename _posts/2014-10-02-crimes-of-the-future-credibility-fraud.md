As we pass day by day into the future, it is not at all clear that modern civilization is 
advancing according to expectations. Scientific progress and better living through nuclear 
chemistry have become objects of suspicion, and the plastic revolution has resulted in a world 
that is increasingly hepatotoxic. Of course, this same complaint could be raised in every 
golden age, as transition metals are generally hard on the liver.

Nevertheless, there have been clear advances. Computation has never been faster or cheaper.
 The world is awash in information and texts of all kinds. Communications between 
 individuals, groups, and systems increases in density on a daily basis. In the face 
 of this importuning connectivity, the critical question becomes who and what to 
 believe. What is actually going on? What should we do? In what should be place our 
 confidence? Who are these people, anyway?

In the future, it will be generally acknowledged that the acid shower of information
provided by communications technologies quickly corrodes the communal ties that bind and, more 
to the point, the civic gates that guard and the barriers that bar. In order to appear 
to be more than a oligarchic tyranny, it is imperative that the governed believe in the
validity (if not the efficiency) of the government. Belief, and the essential credibility
to inspire belief, will be as precious as the dust of Golgotha to those powers that be.

As a result, those powers will need additional powers to claw back the basic First 
Amendment rights to blither inanities, through a few handy additions to the U.S. Code 
Title XVIII. The foremost of these will be the definition of Credibility Fraud as a 
prosecutable offense.

Credibility fraud will be a generalization of the existing offenses involving the conveyance
false and misleading information. However, unlike deceptions that attempt to defraud
persons of property, or obtain benefits from the state, credibility fraud makes an
unsupportable claim against a victim's ability to believe. By promoting a specious 
position, the credibility fraudster increases the risk of a complete collapse of belief
in authority in the victim(s), which is tantamount to a direct attack on the state.

An example: Suppose that a minor celebrity, with fewer than ten million followers on 
ClickTrick, Fumblr, and O*RSpasm, takes to their feeds with a series of posts on the 
benefits of phlebotomy.

Interest in bloodletting paraphernalia may spike briefly, but overall effect of this 
sad display would be a net reduction in the ability of the populace's capacity for belief,
making the perpetrator liable for prosecution under the updated U.S. Code. In this case,
the decease of the actor would nullify the prosecution, at least until the amendment of
Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution to permit the attainder of estates, but we will
leave the discussion of such maneuverings to a later item. Most follies of this type are
not so benign.
