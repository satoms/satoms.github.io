_The Geek Chorus:_ What?

_Myself:_ rum lingua Celt&aelig;, nostra Galli appel

_The Geek Chorus:_ Dood! Snap out of it!

_Myself:_ lantur, in C&aelig;sar's immortal prose.

_The Geek Chorus:_ DOOD!

_Myself:_ What?

_The Geek Chorus:_ What's with the speaking in tongues, man?

_Myself:_ I was merely beginning _in medias res_, to heighten the excitement.

_The Geek Chorus:_ Er, whatever. Where were you?

_Myself:_ I was indisposed.

_The Geek Chorus:_ Sounds like one bad burrito.

_Myself:_ Never you mind. Is there something you wanted in particular?

_The Geek Chorus:_ No, no. Just curious, man.

_Myself:_ I see.

_The Geek Chorus:_ I thought the site might be dead.

_The Geek Chorus:_ The publishing stuff, dood. When will you start?

_Myself:_ Simply consult the page.

**COMMUNIQUE FROM THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE TO RECALL THE GOVERNOR**

Fellow citizens of California, we earnestly pray that you will exercise the franchise tomorrow in the service of conscience. We feel confident that regardless of the outcome, our work will go on. At the end of the election, after the votes are counted and the victor declared, we will still have a governor worthy of recalling in the fullness of time. Volunteers interested in helping the committee schedule the next recall election should contact the Volunteer Coordinator, The Permanent Committee to Recall the Governor, in care of the internet. All volunteers are eligible for snacks, as available.
